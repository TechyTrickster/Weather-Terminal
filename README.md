# Weather-Terminal
A small bash script that will grab the current weather conditions and a 5 day forecast from the US National Weather Service.
I am fairly certain this will only work on US locations.  Has color highlighting for the detailed forecast!

Provide a number at the end to indicate a fixed message width, otherwise, the message will be as wide as the current terminal.

example usage
> ./getWeather.sh Chicago IL

NOTE: the city and the State abriviation must be seperated by a space!

There are two arguments, the city name, and State abriviation.  They must be spelled correctly, and the state abriviation must be all caps.
