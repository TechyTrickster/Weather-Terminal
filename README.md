# Weather-Terminal
A small bash script that will grab the current weather conditions and a 5 day forecast from the US National Weather Service.

example usage
> ./getWeather.sh Chicago IL

NOTE: the city and the State abriviation must be seperated by a space!

There are two arguments, the city name, and State abriviation.  They must be spelled correctly
